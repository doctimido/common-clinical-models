Each item was written to capture a unique manifestation of this particular form of anxiety. Specifically, these included the cognitive (i.e., repetitive thinking; worry; processing biases; dreaming; planning), behavioral (i.e., dysfunctional activities; avoidance; compulsive behaviors), emotional (i.e., fear; anxiety; anger), and physiological (i.e., sleep disturbances; somatic distress; tonic immobility;) dimensions of coronavirus anxiety. Each item was rated on a 5-point scale to reflect the frequency of the symptom, ranging from 0 (not at all) to 4 (nearly every day) over the preceding two weeks. This scaling format is based on the DSM-5’s cross-cutting symptom measure, adult self-rated version (APA, 2013, pp.734), to be consistent with the American Psychiatric Association’s system of measuring psychiatric symptoms over time and response to treatment."
