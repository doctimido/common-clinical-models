test_cases:
- id: Primary classification
  input:
    1:
      gt0003|Wound Features: local::at0004|Clean wounds with minimal tissue loss, e.g. surgical wounds, clean lacerations|
  expected_output:
    1:
      gt0005|Classification: local::at0008|Primary|
      gt0006|Management: local::at0012|Closure ideally performed within 6-8 hours of trauma. If well-vascularized, may be closed up to 24 hours after trauma.|

- id: Secondary classification
  input:
    1:
      gt0003|Wound Features: local::at0005|Significant tissue loss precluding tension-free approximation of edges, devitalized edges, ulcerations, or abscess cavities|
  expected_output:
    1:
      gt0005|Classification: local::at0009|Secondary|
      gt0006|Management: local::at0013|No surgical closure. Daily dressing changes. Consider negative pressure vacuum therapy.|

- id: Tertiary classification 
  input:
    1:
      gt0003|Wound Features: local::at0006|Grossly contaminated wounds with or without significant tissue loss|
  expected_output:
    1:
      gt0005|Classification: local::at0010|Tertiary (Delayed Primary)|
      gt0006|Management: local::at0015|Thoroughly explore, irrigate, and debride. Observe for 3-7 days before surgical closure or skin grafting. May benefit from negative pressure vacuum therapy.|
